# Expanded ARCHIBUS Technologies Examples
==============================

## An expanded ARCHIBUS Technologies section. ##

Additional examples for the ARCHIBUS Technologies section.

Feel free to use these examples to learn even more.

For users:

1. These examples are free to use with no liability under the GPL license.
2. Place files under your ARCHIBUS installation directory's "schema" folder. 
  - ex. ~\ARCHIBUS\webapps\archibus\schema\[place here]
3. Examples can be seen by going to your ARCHIBUS instance URL in your browser of choice and appending "/[file-name]" 
  - ex. http://localhost:8080/archibus/ex-form-action-button.axvw

For contributors:

1. Please create your examples trying to leverage only the ARCHIBUS APIs. If you need custom functions and methods to manipulate the DOM (for JavaScript) or Database/Class (for Java) then it is not an example of using the ARCHIBUS API's.
2. Please pay attention to deprecation of segments of the ARCHIBUS API.
3. Base all examples off the ARCHIBUS HQ dataset.
4. Currently these examples are based off of ARCHIBUS v21.3 for simplicity. I plan to create branches per version in the near future.
5. Follow the ARCHIBUS file naming conventions as described [here.] (http://www.archibus.com/ai/abizfiles/v21.3_help/system_management_help/afm-sysman.htm#wc_views/simple_views_techniques/Name_a_new_view.htm%3FTocPath%3DAdd-In%2520Manager%7CSkills%7C_____11)
